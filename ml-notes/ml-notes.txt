    Object Recognition is the task of being given an image and from that image trying to associate it to a class or category (e.g. given a picture of a cat identify it as a cat)
    Challenges:
        Semantic Gap: How we view an image is very different from a computer since we view things with a sense of intuition but a computer 
                      can only see things as pixel values, and thus small changes in the picture can make it difficult for a computer
                      to identify something as a cat
        Viewpoint Variation: A change of angle vastly changes the pixel values in a region
        Illumination: Lighting changes pixel values (e.g. in a bright light on a black and white image it would tend towards white as opposed to a dark
                                                          image which would be dark)
        Deformation: When the actual object that is trying to be predicted on changes position (e.g. a sitting human vs a standing human)
        Occlusion: When some parts of the object are hidden 
        Background Clutter: When the background looks similar to the object being identified
        Intraclass Differentiaton: When different objects of a class look different but are still part of the same class (e.g. differnt types of monkeys)
    Because of these challenges it is very difficult to code an "algorithm" or set step procedure to identify these photos
    Thus we have adopted a data driven approach where we say given this data and what class it should be in we will try to minimize the error of prediction 
    (through optimizing a loss function with respect to weights in terms of a NN)
